# The Anthropological Notation Ontology (ANNO)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/473966297.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/473966297)

ANNO consists of ANNOdc (domain-core) and ANNOds (domain-specific).
ANNOdc is connected to the General Formal Ontology (GFO).

## Releases

The complete ANNO ontology including ANNOds is only included in releases right now and not in the repository itself.
Releases have the [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/) scheme YY.MM for short year and short month.
For example, [23.08](https://github.com/annosaxfdm/ontology/releases/tag/23.08) is the state of August, 2023 and contains the ontology as <https://github.com/annosaxfdm/ontology/releases/download/23.08/anno.owl>.
Each release *must* include `anno.owl` as attached binary, leading to the dynamic link to the newest version at <https://github.com/annosaxfdm/ontology/releases/latest/download/anno.owl>.
Each release *must not* be set as pre-release because that breaks the GitHub shorthand link.
