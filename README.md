# The Anthropological Notation Ontology (ANNO)
ANNO is under development in 2022 and 2023.
The ontology is neither stable, correct nor complete yet and can only be used for testing and development.

## Releases

The ANNO ontology is only included in releases right now and not in the repository itself.
Releases have the [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/) scheme YY.MM (later) or YY.MM.DD (while under heavy development, short year, short month and short day).
For example, [22.08.04](https://github.com/annosaxfdm/ontology/releases/tag/22.08.04) is the state of August 4, 2022 and contains the ontology as <https://github.com/annosaxfdm/ontology/releases/download/22.08.04/anno.owl>.
Each release *must* include `anno.owl` as attached binary, leading to the dynamic link to the newest version at <https://github.com/annosaxfdm/ontology/releases/latest/download/anno.owl>.
Each release *must not* be set as pre-release because that breaks the GitHub shorthand link.
